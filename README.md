# Advent of Code 2021

I originally started doing Advent of Code 2021 at release, but I was not able to solve every day at the time. I went back in 2024 to finish the rest of the days and got all the 50 stars.

Run using cargo (put input in "/input" at root with the name "dayX.txt"):
> cargo run --bin dayX
